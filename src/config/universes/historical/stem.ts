/**
 * Invention of the Electric Telegraph - Revolution in Communication
 *
 * This universe documents the period of invention and early commercialization of the
 * electric telegraph, a technology that fundamentally altered long-distance communication.
 * It covers the initial conceptual work by various inventors and culminates in the
 * first major public demonstration and subsequent commercial network expansion.
 *
 * Cultural Significance: 0.98 - The telegraph was the foundational technology of the
 * global telecommunications network, enabling near-instantaneous communication across
 * vast distances for the first time. It directly led to the development of modern
 * stock tickers, news wire services, and global financial markets.
 *
 * Reality Relation: documentary with 0.0 fictionalization
